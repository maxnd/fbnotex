fbNotex is a free software for macOS able to manage a large amount of textual notes on a single computer or in a local network using the open source database Firebird (firebirdsql.org). fbNotex is a fork of sqlNotex.

The notes are divided into notebooks and, within them, in sections, and it is possible to associate to each note a list of activities to be done, a series of attachments (files of any kind), tags and links to other notes. The search function may find the wished notes starting from the title, the text content, the modification date, the tags, the name of the attachments or activities. Files of Microsoft Word (docx), LibreOffice Writer (odt) and in plain text (txt) can be imported as plain text in a new note, while in the first two cases the original file is attached to it.

The text of the notes, if it is written by the user in Markdown format, may be displayed in the browser or inserted into a new Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer document, thus obtaining a regularly formatted text.

fbNotex has been written with Lazarus (www.lazarus-ide.org) and accesses the Firebird database through the Zeos components ([sourceforge.net/projects/zeoslib](sourceforge.net/projects/zeoslib)).
